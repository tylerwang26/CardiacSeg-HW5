檢查5 fold是否繼續訓練中

**Checking Training Status**

I'm currently focused on determining if the 5-fold training is active. I'm starting by identifying any running Python processes that might be related, specifically looking for `nnUNet` processes. Then, I'll examine the logs and output directories for recent updates to confirm the training's status.


**Confirming Active Processes**

I'm now zeroing in on confirming active processes. My initial step involves executing a command to list all Python processes within the terminal. Following that, I'll filter these processes, specifically looking for `nnUNet` related processes to ascertain whether the training scripts are actively running. This should give a good overview of the training's status.

**Assessing Current Processes**

I'm back to monitoring the training status. My initial process listing was cut short, so I'm trying again. First, I'll identify any active Python processes. Second, if any look like they are training, I will then assess the training logs.


**Retracing My Steps**

I'm restarting the process. My previous attempt was cut short, so I need to re-establish the situation. First, I'm checking for Python processes that look like training runs. Then, I'll examine the modification times of the log files within `nnUNet_results` to confirm ongoing updates. This should clarify if the 5-fold training is progressing as expected.

先依.gitignore, 上傳本資料夾

我會幫您將符合 .gitignore 規則的檔案上傳到 Git。讓我先檢查當前的 Git 狀態，然後進行提交和推送。
